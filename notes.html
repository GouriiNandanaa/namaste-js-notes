<!-- 
everything inside js happens inside an execution context 

executiion context is like a box with 2 sections
1-------memory// variable environment
    all variables functions are stored here as key value pairs

    a:10
    function: {...}
2--------code//thread of execution
    here the code is stored and executed in a single line 
-->      







<!-- 
js is a synchronous and single threaded language
